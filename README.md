## Hi there, I'm Arushi ðŸ‘‹

#### I am a web developer, techie, debater and feminist from Gurgaon. I'm currently a sophomore at the Manipal Institute of Technology, and graduated from the Shri Ram School, Moulsari. I love writing & tech & talking and hence, I cofounded [thesilentgeeks.com](https://thesilentgeeks.com/). During the times I'm not staring at VSCode, I can be found watching Gilmore Girls ~~for the 87256x time~~ or reading a Jan Austen novel.

#### Currently, I mostly work in Next.js and React. I love the process of having a clean figma file and step by step translating it into beauiful responsive web pages. I absolutely love hackathons and fast-paced process of ideating and coding. 

**I'm always looking for cool impactful projects so reach out to me :)**
